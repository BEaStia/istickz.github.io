  <p>
    There is this problem that when you schedule a background job from inside of a running database transaction, the background job can kick in before the transaction is commited. Then the job can&#8217;t find the data that it expects to already be there, in database. How do we solve this issue?

  <p>
    In this article you learned how to create objects using FactoryGirl for a has_one association in Rails. I do not recommend using FactoryGirl on new projects, it has convoluted syntax and adds to your learning curve which can make it difficult to keep your tests up-to date in a team with varying skill sets.

In some cases, the chaining level was up to 5 objects, like account.owner.company.tags.first.

    This is the story a woefully slow API endpoint. It starts out unprotected and naive; recalculating the world on every request and vulnerable to floods of traffic.

    The last time I worked on OpsWorks I needed to implement a recipe to handle the setup and configuration of cron jobs. Actually I had already written some code to handle this functionality in the past. However, the recipe I ended up with wasn&#8217;t particularly flexible.
